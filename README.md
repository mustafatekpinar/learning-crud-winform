# Basic CRUD WinForms Application (Learning Project)

This is a beginner-level Windows Forms application created during my early C# learning journey.  
It demonstrates simple **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations on a list with a dynamic refresh after each action.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Add new records  
- Update existing records  
- Delete selected records  
- Automatically refresh the list after each operation  
- Simple and clean WinForms-based UI

Internally, after each add / update / delete action, the application calls a method to **reload and rebind the list**, so the UI always shows the latest state.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Framework**
- **Windows Forms**
- **MSSQL**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is not intended to be a production application.  
It is kept public as part of my **learning journey**, to show how I practiced:

- Basic data manipulation logic in C#
- UI updates after CRUD operations
- Structuring small WinForms projects
